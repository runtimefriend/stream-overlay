confetti 1st chatter video overlay
GET CHAT WORKING SO EVERYONE CAN SEE CHAT


Couldn't find something useful to use or extend.



convert register system so that overlay registers it automatically on plugin integration. Set this.ID parameter and get the class somehow? JS src tag runs in its own scope? So potentially get a generic variable from that scope?

Chyron CSS was transferred and CSS not working correctly now.

WHAT WE NEED:
  ability for every streamer to control
  reaction videos/audio
  ability to integrate custom reaction search/display
  custom triggerable HTML widgets
  styling chyron overlay widget
  get push setup with the server





LEFT OFF:
  starting dashboard work for controlling overlay

  overlay html in progess, needs styling, and more commands

  connect overlay and dashboard with websockets

  master overlay on streamer, and everyone has a dashboard
